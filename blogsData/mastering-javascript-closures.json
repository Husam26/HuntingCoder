    "content": "## Introduction\nJavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that allows functions to retain access to variables from their parent scope even after the parent function has executed.\n\n## What is a Closure?\nA closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing.\n\n```js\nfunction outerFunction(outerVariable) {\n  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {\n    console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);\n  };\n}\n\nconst newFunction = outerFunction('Hello');\nnewFunction('World');\n// Output: Outer: Hello, Inner: World\n```\n\n## Why Are Closures Useful?\nClosures allow for data encapsulation and maintaining state in JavaScript, making them valuable in scenarios like:\n- Private variables\n- Callback functions\n- Event handlers\n- Functional programming\n\n## Practical Example: Creating a Counter\nA common use of closures is creating private variables for a counter function:\n\n```js\nfunction createCounter() {\n  let count = 0;\n  return function () {\n    count++;\n    console.log(`Current Count: ${count}`);\n  };\n}\n\nconst counter = createCounter();\ncounter(); // Current Count: 1\ncounter(); // Current Count: 2\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nClosures are an essential part of JavaScript that help developers write cleaner, more modular code. Understanding closures will greatly improve your ability to write efficient and maintainable JavaScript programs."
