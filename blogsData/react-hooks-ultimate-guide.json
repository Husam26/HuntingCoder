    "content": "## Introduction\nReact Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, allow functional components to manage state and side effects without needing class components. Hooks simplify React development and make code more readable and maintainable.\n\n## Why Use Hooks?\nHooks offer several advantages over class components, including:\n- Better readability\n- Reusability through custom hooks\n- Elimination of lifecycle method confusion\n- Improved performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders\n\n## Commonly Used Hooks\n### 1. useState - Managing State in Functional Components\nThe `useState` hook allows components to manage local state.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. useEffect - Handling Side Effects\nThe `useEffect` hook allows components to perform side effects such as data fetching or DOM manipulation.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction Timer() {\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n      setSeconds(s => s + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup function\n  }, []);\n  return <p>Seconds elapsed: {seconds}</p>;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. useContext - Managing Global State\nThe `useContext` hook makes it easier to manage state without prop drilling.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useContext, createContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nfunction ThemeComponent() {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>;\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Hooks\n- `useReducer`: For complex state logic\n- `useRef`: For accessing DOM elements\n- `useMemo` & `useCallback`: For performance optimizations\n\n## Conclusion\nReact Hooks make functional components more powerful by adding state and side-effect management. Mastering hooks will significantly improve your React development skills."
